# dynamichannel
Revolt.chat bot utilizing the Voltage wrapper.
The bot will have a voice channel that a user will be able to join when then creates a new voice channel with the user's name (SinfulPhantom's Party) and transfer the user to the newly created Voice Channel.

The current API does not support Voice Channels yet, so the feature of dynamically creating a channel is on standby
